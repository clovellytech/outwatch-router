outwatch-router [![Build Status][travis-img]][travis-link]
===

Easy routing for [outwatch](https://outwatch.github.io) on scala.js

Most of this code is adapted from [http4s](http4s.org)'s route parsing and path pattern matching. 

See [documentation][doc-root]

Todo: 

* Add history api
* Add state to update from `window.location`
