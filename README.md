Easy routing for [outwatch](https://outwatch.github.io) on scala.js

Most of this code is adapted from [http4s](http://http4s.org)'s route parsing and path pattern matching. 

Add to library dependencies:

```
	"com.clovellytech" %%% "outwatch-router" % "0.0.7"
```

See [documentation][doc-root]

This router is also demonstrated at [outwatch-examples](https://github.com/clovellytech/outwatch-examples).

Todo:
* Work on documentation, provide example of links
